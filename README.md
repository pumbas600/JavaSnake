# JAVASNAKE

JavaSnake is my version of the iconic snake game built in Java using Javafx.
Currently, JavaSnake is still underdevelopment.

## GETTING STARTED: 

The most recent JavaSnake `.jar` file can be found in `out\artifacts\JavaSnake_jar\` and should be called `JavaSnake.jar`.

Alternatvely, a currently slightly outdated version of this file can be download from MEGA [here](https://mega.nz/#!RJliCS4a!vvarkseMkx3qJFrJDfrivSu5VM7AFjVizetYU2jbUgI)

## FEATURES:

> Basic Snake gameplay.

> Score counter.

> High score display.
